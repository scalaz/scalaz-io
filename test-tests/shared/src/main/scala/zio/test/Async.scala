/**
 * `Async` is a thin functional wrapper around `scala.concurrent.Future` for
 * use in the ZIO Test internal test suite. All methods except `run` merely
 * describe actions and no effects will be run until `run` is called as long as
 * the underlying `Future` is not already "in flight" when the `Async` is
 * constructed. Note that this implementation is not stack safe for deeply
 * recursive calls but since we are only using this to sequence the tests in
 * the ZIO Test test suite that is okay. For any application you would be
 * dramatically better off using `ZIO` and higher level constructs such as
 * `ZStream` built on top of it, but we can't do that here since we are using
 * ZIO Test to test `ZIO` itself.
