The ZIO library provides a general-purpose effect monad and associated abstractions for purely functional Scala applications.

The package strives to deliver on the following design goals:

 - **Principled**. A purely functional interface for effectful code with rigorous, well-defined semantics.
 - **Performant**. A low-level, highly-optimized runtime system that offers performance better than or comparable to other effect monads.
 - **Pragmatic**. The composable, orthogonal primitives necessary to build real world software, including primitives for concurrent and asynchronous programming.

**Documentation** and **Examples** can be found on the [microsite](https://scalaz.github.io/scalaz-zio/).
