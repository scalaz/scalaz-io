# Welcome to ZIO


ZIO is a zero-dependency Scala library for asynchronous and concurrent programming.

Powered by highly-scalable, non-blocking fibers that never waste or leak resources, ZIO lets you build scalable, resilient, and reactive applications that meet the needs of your business.

 - **High-performance**. Build scalable applications with 100x the performance of Scala's `Future`.
 - **Type-safe**. Use the full power of the Scala compiler to catch bugs at compile time.
 - **Concurrent**. Easily build concurrent apps without deadlocks, race conditions, or complexity.
 - **Asynchronous**. Write sequential code that looks the same whether it's asynchronous or synchronous.
 - **Resource-safe**. Build apps that never leak resources (including threads!), even when they fail.
 - **Testable**. Inject test services into your app for fast, deterministic, and type-safe testing.
 - **Resilient**. Build apps that never lose errors, and which respond to failure locally and flexibly.
 - **Functional**. Rapidly compose solutions to complex problems from simple building blocks.
