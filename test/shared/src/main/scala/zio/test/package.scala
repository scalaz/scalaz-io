/**
 * _ZIO Test_ is a featherweight testing library for effectful programs.
 *
 * The library imagines every spec as an ordinary immutable value, providing
 * tremendous potential for composition. Thanks to tight integration with ZIO,
 * specs can use resources (including those requiring disposal), have well-
 * defined linear and parallel semantics, and can benefit from a host of ZIO
 * combinators.
