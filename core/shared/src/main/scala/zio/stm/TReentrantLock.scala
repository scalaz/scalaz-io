/**
 * A `TReentrantLock` is a reentrant read/write lock. Multiple readers may all
 * concurrently acquire read locks. Only one writer is allowed to acquire a
 * write lock at any given time. Read locks may be upgraded into write locks.
 * A fiber that has a write lock may acquire other write locks or read locks.
 *
 * The two primary methods of this structure are `readLock`, which acquires a
 * read lock in a managed context, and `writeLock`, which acquires a write lock
 * in a managed context.
 *
 * Although located in the STM package, there is no need for locks within
 * STM transactions. However, this lock can be quite useful in effectful code,
 * to provide consistent read/write access to mutable state; and being in STM
 * allows this structure to be composed into more complicated concurrent
 * structures that are consumed from effectful code.
